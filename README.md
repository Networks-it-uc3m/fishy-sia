Public repository for the FISHY Secure Interface Abstraction (SIA)

This respository describes the implementation corresponding to the Secure infrastructure Abstraction (**SIA**) module of the [FISHY project](https://fishy-project.eu). An initial design of the SIA has been presented in [deliverable D2.2](https://fishy-project.eu/library/deliverables) of FISHY. In the following, we review the architectural design of this module, describing the refinements that have been specified as a result of the research and implementation work conducted during the i the project.
